        <p>Hello! My name is Angela and this is my first website! This has been an exciting assignment with a lot of roadblocks, leaving me feeling accomplished when I finished. I can't wait to continue building on top of this code to create an amazing website. Keep reading if you would like to know more about me...</p>

        <p>I was born in the tiny town of Brooksville, FLorida, but I grew up in Tucson and consider it my hometown. I have two funny dogs, Joey and Cheeto. I joined the Coding Bootcamp in the hopes of creating a better future for myself, as well as being able to give my dogs the backyard they deserve!I love baseball and hockey but I don't have a favorite team in either sport; I just really love going to as many games as possible so I don't care whose playing. On my spare time I like to go hunting for unique new and vintage clothing and read any good book I can get my hands on!</p>
